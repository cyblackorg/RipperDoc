**Why RipperDoc Matters**: Modern healthcare requires sophisticated technology solutions that can handle the complexity of medical operations while maintaining the highest standards of patient care and data security. RipperDoc delivers the tools healthcare professionals need to focus on what matters most - patient outcomes.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker and Docker Compose** (recommended setup)
- **OpenAI API key** for AI assistant functionality
- OR Node.js (v16+) and PostgreSQL for manual setup

## Quick Setup

I made a [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/h3jm83jw33Q) explaining everything.

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aligorithm/ripperdoc.git
cd ripperdoc
```

### 2. AI Provider Configuration

RipperDoc uses **OpenAI** for AI assistant functionality. You'll need an OpenAI API key to use the chatbot features.

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
docker-compose up --build
```

**Note:** You may need to run docker-compose with sudo, and this may lead to environment variables not being passed from the shell. If you're having issues with the AI assistant, try this:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY docker-compose up --build
```
